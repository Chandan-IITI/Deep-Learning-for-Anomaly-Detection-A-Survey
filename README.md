# Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection : A Survey

 The aim of this survey is two fold, firstly we present a structured and comprehensive reviewof research methods in deep anomaly detection (DAD). Furthermore, we also discuss the adoption of DAD methods across various application domains and assess their effectiveness.

## Contributing

Please leave a comment  if you wish to get your work be included in the survey kindly leave paper title and preferably bibtex entry [here] (https://github.com/raghavchalapathy/Deep-Learning-for-Anomaly-Detection-A-Survey/issues) in Issue list section

I would be updating the paper every two-weeks and will be including and citing your paper in the appropriate sections of research or application sections. This enables us to keep track and follow the recent progress in the space of deep learning based techniques for anomaly detection.
